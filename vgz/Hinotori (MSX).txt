Notes:
Pack was made using
NEZplug 0.9.4.8+2+19.20 VGM mod
and .KSS file from http://kss.joshw.info/MSX/.

This game is based on the fifth volume of the
Osamu Tezuka manga series of the same title.
Konami released a Famicom game also, utilizing
the same source material. Tracks 01 and 08
borrow some melodies from the ending song of
the 1986 film adaptation of Hō-ō Hen, which was
composed by Fumio Miyashita. It can be found on
the album "Hinotori" (07SH-2012).

One of my favourite video game soundtracks.
Having watched several of the Hinotori OVAs and
films at a young age, both it and the game also
have a strong nostalgic feeling for me.
